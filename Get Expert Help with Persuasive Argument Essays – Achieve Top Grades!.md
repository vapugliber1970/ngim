## What Is a Persuasive Argument Essay?

A **persuasive argument essay** is a type of academic writing where you present an argument on a particular issue or topic and aim to convince your readers of your perspective. To be successful, a persuasive essay needs to be well-structured, logically sound, and based on strong evidence.
